I still remember how it used to be
Holding hands, running wild and free
Crossed our hearts, said we'd never let go
(We'd never let go)
I still think about our younger days
How we dreamed about a better life
Holding you so close to me
In the back seat of your ride
We fell apart thought we lost everything
Just lost in our memories
And I sure hope you do
Remember me like I remember
Like I remember you
(Do you remember me?) like I remember you
(Do you remember me?) like I remember you
We drew our names in the pavement
Thinking about how we'd never change
I still remember how it used to be
(How it used to be)
I still think about our younger days
How we dreamed about a better life
Holding you so close to me
In the back seat of your ride
We fell apart thought we lost everything
Just lost in our memories
And I sure hope you do
Remember me like I remember
Like I remember you like I remember you
We fell apart thought we lost everything
Just lost in our memories
And I sure hope you do
Remember me like I remember
Like I remember you
